            <!-- Career Transition Statement -->
<!-- <div class="collapsible-section">
    <button class="collapsible">Why I Want to Switch</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            After a fulfilling tenure at Amazon where I've had the privilege of leading high-performing teams and driving operational excellence, I am strategically positioning myself for the next phase of my professional journey. My military background instilled in me a commitment to continuous growth and the pursuit of new challenges that expand one's capabilities. While I deeply value the structured environment and data-driven approach at Amazon, I am seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my unique blend of military precision and corporate innovation in environments where I can make transformative contributions to organizational strategy and leadership development.
        </p>
        <p>
            My decision is guided by a disciplined assessment of my long-term career trajectory rather than dissatisfaction with my current role. I believe my potential for impact lies in environments where I can fully leverage both my operational expertise and strategic vision to shape organizational culture and mentor the next generation of leaders. This transition represents a measured advancement toward roles where I can contribute to building resilient, adaptable, and forward-looking operational frameworks while continuing to uphold the standards of excellence and integrity that have defined my career thus far.
